## Learning Goals
1. Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
2. Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage classes, creating and using an effective data model
3. Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
4. Use problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust that you don't need an outside "answer" to a logical challenge.

## Application Features
![New page](assets/Rock Paper Scissors Game.mov)
* On page load, the welcome page is displayed where you can choose which game you would like to play. When you go into one game or the other you can start to play against the computer. When you click on a weapon it will show you your choice and the computers choice with who won that round. When a win happens it will be recorded under the player (human or computer) as wins. The wins will persist until you decide you would like to "reset score" or "reset game". You can move back and forth from the Classic game or the Modern game as many times as you would like.
